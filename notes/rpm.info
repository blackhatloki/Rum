  Preventing Yum from Updating the Kernel
  However, if you don’t ever want to just blindly have the kernel updated, you
  can add the following to your /etc/yum.conf file:

  exclude=kernel*

  Or, if you insist on using a vanilla configuration file and control
  everything via the CLI, use

  #yum –exclude=kernel* update

  Both of these methods will eliminate the kernel from being updated or even
  included in the potential update listing.

yum –exclude Command Line Option
Finally, you can skip yum command updates on command line itself using
following syntax:
# yum --exclude=package\* update
# yum --exclude=php\* update
# yum --exclude=kernel\* update
# yum -x 'kernel*' -x 'php*' update
