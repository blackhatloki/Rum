Re: Virtual Disk commands using RACADM
I'm reasonably certain that I tried this multiple times and using various
command sequences without success. But inspired by Daniel's comments, I tried
again and this time it worked. The following commands seem to work properly
using iDRAC8 on R230s and iDRAC7 on R520s; I presume they will also work on
other systems with those iDRAC models.

racadm remoteimage -c -u xxx -p xxx -l xx.xx.xx.xx:/path/to/xxx.iso
racadm set iDRAC.VirtualMedia.BootOnce 1
racadm set iDRAC.ServerBoot.FirstBootDevice VCD-DVD
racadm serveraction powercycle

Of course, I need to leave the image connected during the boot, which is after
my script terminates. That means I need to find a reliable, and preferably
automatic, way to disconnect the image after I'm done using it. I'm still
working that issue.

Note that the remoteimage command applied to an NFS share as shown above still
requires the -u and -p options, though the server ignores them. Why does racadm
require them?
