Re: Processor Power settings in BIOS and racadm
Looks like the following racadm command in the BIOS.SysProfileSettings group is
the right one

BIOS.SysProfileSettings.ProcPwrPerf

the options are:

• MaxPerf

• MinPwr

• SysDbpm

• OsDbpm

Is there anybody at Dell that can confirm that a reboot is required or if there
is another racadm command that can force the above setting change to become
active?
