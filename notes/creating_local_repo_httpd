Create a Local Repository
The first step involves copying the iso file from the Centos 7 installation DVD
into the system.

It is important to install ‘createrepo’ package to successfully create local
repository database. This is achieved by the following command.


yum install createrepo

yum install createrepo
The next logical step is simply to create a directory.


mkdir –p /repos/centos/7/Packages

mkdir –p /repos/centos/7/Packages
Mount the iso file inside /repos/centos/7/Packages folder.


Mount iso-file-path /repos/centos/7/Packages

Mount iso-file-path /repos/centos/7/Packages
We make use of Apache web server and install it.


yum install httpd

yum install httpd
We should create a directory in the web server folder to store packages from
the /repos/centos/7/Packages folder

Please use the following command to make a directory /var/www/html in the
webserver folder.


mkdir –p /var/www/html/centos

mkdir –p /var/www/html/centos
Copy the packages in /repos/centos/7/Packages to the directory /var/www/html
created in the above step.


cp -ar /repos/centos/7/Packages/* /var/www/html/centos

cp -ar /repos/centos/7/Packages/* /var/www/html/centos
If all the packages are successfully copied you can unmount the iso file from
/repos/centos/7/Packages folder using the following command.


umount /repos/centos/7/Packages

umount /repos/centos/7/Packages
 

 The next obvious step is to create a repository file called “localrepo.repo”
 in /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. Please note that you can name this file as per
 your wish.


 vi /etc/yum.repos.d/localrepo.repo

 vi /etc/yum.repos.d/localrepo.repo
 Add the following lines in the repository file “localrepo.repo”.


 [localrepo]
 name=polyglotit Repository
 baseurl=file:///var/www/html/centos
 gpgcheck=0
 enabled=1
 
 [localrepo]
 name=polyglotit Repository
 baseurl=file:///var/www/html/centos
 gpgcheck=0
 enabled=1
 Now you should initialize & update the repository on the web server folder
 using the ‘createrepo’ command as follows


 createrepo -v /var/www/html/centos

 createrepo --update /var/www/html/centos
 
 createrepo -v /var/www/html/centos
  
 createrepo --update /var/www/html/centos
  The next step is to list out the repositories using the command as shown
  below.


  yum repolist
  yum repolist
  Make use of Apache in publishing a repository over HTTP
  We have already installed the apache web server (httpd), hence we move
  forward with the following steps.

  Clean the yum cache and update the repository lists.


  sudo yum clean all

  sudo yum –y update
  sudo yum clean all
   
   sudo yum –y update
   Firewall should not block httpd, hence we provide httpd access through the
   firewall.


   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp

   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp

   systemctl restart firewalld
   
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
    
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
     
   systemctl restart firewalld
   Please start and make to enable the httpd service on boot.


   systemctl start httpd

   systemctl enable httpd
   systemctl start httpd
        
   systemctl enable httpd
   Configuration on a Client side
   Navigate to repository file location


   cd  /etc/yum.repos.d
   
  cd  /etc/yum.repos.d
  Create a configuration file local.repo with the following command
  line as shown.


  vi local.repo
  
  vi local.repo
  Please add the following lines in the configuration file created in
  the above step.


  [mylocalrepo]
  name=localcentosrepo
  baseurl=http://ip-address-of-the-server-computer/centos
  gpgcheck=0
  enabled=1
          
  [mylocalrepo]
  name=localcentosrepo
  baseurl=http://ip-address-of-the-server-computer/centos
  gpgcheck=0
  enabled=1
