Backup Your Entire Linux System Using Rsync
First, insert your backup medium (USB thumb drive or External hard disk). Then
find the drive letter using ‘fdisk -l’ command. In my case, my Pen drive id is
/dev/sdb1. Mount your drive to any location of your choice. I am going to mount
it under /mnt.

$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
To backup the entire system, all you have to do is open your Terminal and run
the following command as root user:

$ sudo rsync -aAXv /
--exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*","/run/*","/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"}
/mnt
This command will backup the entire root ( / ) directory, excluding /dev,
/proc, /sys, /tmp, /run, /mnt, /media, /lost+found directories, and save the
data in /mnt folder.

Let us break down the above command and see what each argument does.

rsync – A fast, versatile, local and remote file-copying utility
-aAXv – The files are transferred in “archive” mode, which ensures that
symbolic links, devices, permissions, ownerships, modification times, ACLs, and
extended attributes are preserved.
/ – Source directory
–exclude – Excludes the given directories from backup.
/mnt – It is the backup destination folder.
Please be mindful that you must exclude the destination directory, if it exists
in the local system. It will avoid the an infinite loop.
