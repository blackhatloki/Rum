Tony,

OK.  To get a different version we have to ask for it from DDN, probably through a ticket.
We can do that, but just to double check:

-- Are you installing from lustre-client-2.7.19.8.ddn5.g60f692f ?

-- You might be doing it this way already, but I have had the best luck as follows:

1)  Do a blanket yum update (probably includes the kernel) and a reboot before anything else.

2)  Remove any older kernel packages so none of the other installations get confused.

3)  Build OFED, and make sure it builds cleanly without warnings.

4)  For Lustre (EXAScaler), I am attaching the manual closest to the version we have.  They have instructions at "6.1 Building Client Packages".  We start from there, BUT we need the --with-o2ib= option.  
Would would seem to make sense is:

./configure --with-linux=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/source --disable-server --with-o2ib=/usr/src/mlnx-ofa_kernel-3.4

However, that never seems to work.  What has worked for me is:

./configure --with-linux=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/source --disable-server --with-o2ib=/usr/src/ofa_kernel/default

The latter directory comes from the same package anyway.

5)  As in their document, the actual compilation step is.
make rpms

6)  Finally install the rpms.  Any warnings?

Is this what you are doing?

Eric
