Installing the driver on Red Hat Linux 6/7 or CentOS 6/7
Note: You must have root privilege to complete this task.
To install the DKMS driver on Red Hat Linux 6/7 or CentOS 6/7:

Become the root user:
$sudo su
Install the prerequisite packages:
# yum install kernel kernel-devel kernel-headers gcc
Reboot the system.
Become root:
$sudo su
Extract the driver source code:
# tar –xvf aacraid_src.tgz
Compile the driver:
# make –C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd` modules
Copy the kernel driver file to /lib/modules for inclusion in initramfs (Linux Initial RAM File System):
# cp ./aacraid.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/scsi/aacraid
Note: Delete the old driver (if any), before copying the new one.
Update initramfs to include the driver in the new kernel:
# dracut -v -f --drivers aacraid
Reboot the system.
