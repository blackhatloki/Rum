Create A List Of Installed Packages In CentOS and install them later
First, we will see how to do it in CentOS system. I tested this guide on CentOS
7 server edition. However, it this method should work on other YUM based
distros such as RHEL, Fedora, Scientific Linux etc.

Create the list of installed packages using command:

# rpm -qa | sort > pkglist.txt
Here,

rpm – RPM Package Manager
-qa – Query all installed packages
sort – sort lines of text files
pkglist.txt – The file where we save the list of installed packages.
The above command will list of all installed packages on your CentOS 7 machine
and save them in a file called pkglist.txt in your current working directory.

Now, we have created the list of installed packages. Keep this list safe. We
need it later. Go ahead and format your system.

After reinstalling your Linux box, copy the pkglist.txt file to your system.
You can also copy this file to any remote system using scp command. Just make
sure you have installed the same version OS on your remote system.

# scp pkglist user@remotesystem:/path/
Ex:

# scp pkglist.txt root@192.168.43.150:/root/
Finally, install the packages from the pkglist.txt file using the following
command as root user:

# yum install $(cat /root/pkglist.txt|xargs)
Replace the path of /root/pkglist.txt file with your own.

Done! The package manager will install all packages listed in the pkglist.txt
file on your CentOS box.



You can use this pkglist.txt file to all systems on your network. Please note
that the package manager will only install the packages from the default
official repositories. If you have enabled any other extra repositories on your
old system, you need to add them first before installing the software.
